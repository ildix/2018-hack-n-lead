# AUTH SOME NEWS

```js
We address trust in the published news content offered to the readers based on
Ethereum.  In our framework a trusted author can register new content in the
news ledger, and potential contential content publishers can buy the rights to
use content.  The receipt they get contains the details of the transaction,
verifiable on Etherscan.  Both authenticity of the content and the legal usage
of the content are thus enforced. 
We propose a chrome extension that makes the provenance of content pieces
visible and easily verifiable to the end consumer.
